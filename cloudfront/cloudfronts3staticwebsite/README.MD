# cloudfronts3staticwebsite

This project creates a CloudFront distribution in front of a S3 Static Website.

## How to test

- Upload index.html and error.html files into the bucket created;
- Try to open the object URL of the file that you've just uploaded. Access denied right?;
- Now, try to open using the distribution domain name generated by CloudFront including file name. Something like https://{...}.cloudfront.net/file.jpg;
