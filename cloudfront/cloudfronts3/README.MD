# cloudfronts3

This project creates:
- A CloudFront distribution in front a S3 private bucket
    - CachingOptimized as the cache policy configured;
    - Georestriction configured;

## How to test

- Upload a file into the bucket created;
- Try to open the object URL of the file that you've just uploaded. Access denied right?;
- Now, try to open using the distribution domain name generated by CloudFront including file name. Something like https://{...}.cloudfront.net/file.jpg;
