# apigatewayregionaldomainnamebasepath

This project creates a REST Regional API Gateway with domain name and base path.

## Pre requirements

- A DNS registered;
- A certificate generated by Certificate Manager
    - The domain name must be equals to the DNS or you can use *. For example, if the DNS is quicktutorialswithaws.com, the domain name of the certificate could be the same or *.quicktutorialswithaws.com
- A hosted zone created using Route 53

## Parameters

- RecordSetName: must be the domain name of your certificate or, if you use * to create the certificate, you can add some prefix, for example api.quicktutorialswithaws.com
- HostedZoneId: must be the ID of the hosted zone associated to the DNS;

## How to invoke

```
curl -v https://{domain_name}/{base_path}/customers
```

- {domain_name}: it is the domain name where the gateway was registered and 
- {base_path}: it is the base path configured for the API.
